# Summarise the project and what problem it was solving.

# Airgead Banking
This project is an investment banking app. The program is designed to help students understand the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make). The program will allow users to see how their investments will grow over time.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did very well with programming the app to calculate the investment overtime based on the initial deposit, monthly investment, rate and the number of years.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code fell short at input validation. Had I done a better job at formatting the code for input validation it would have aligned more with the industry standards.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
I had a hard time reducing the code in my main. Unfortunately I was not able to overcome this and my main code was not sufficiently minimised.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
For this project I was able to work with more than one programming language. This ability to combine multiple programming languages is no doubt very valuable as many companies or projects require the use of multiple programming languages for optimum outcome.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to make the program maintainable, readable and adaptable by adding sufficient comments to each section of the program so that the next person to touch the program would understand it enough to maintain, read and adapt the code.
